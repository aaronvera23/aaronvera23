# Hello! I'm Aaron Vera 👋

I'm a web developer who gets lost in the sauce. 

- Laravel/PHP is my jam 🐘
- VueJS makes me vue 🦖
- React gets me to react 🚀
- Love building side projects that go nowhere 🤷‍♂️
- Productivity level: Sloth 🦥
- Always looking to connect for a 🍻 

When I'm not coding, you can find me:

- Trying to convince my dog that the UPS guy is not an intruder 🐶 
- Thinking through plot holes in the MCU 🎥
- On the eternal quest for the perfect slice of pizza 🍕

Want to chat code, movies, or anything else? Hit me up! I'm always happy to nerd out. 🤓

And yes, I did come up with these puns all by myself. I'll be here all week! 🎤
